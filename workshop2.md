# Workshop 2

In this workshop we will be taking a quick look at building a DApp, and then we will let you take over and build one yourself. 

The challenge is, in your groups, identify an idea and implement an MVP DApp. Each member of the group must make at least 1 commit to the repo.


## Getting Started

One person can fork this repo: #INSERT-EDITED-PET-SHOP 
and give all team members permission to push.


Send the link to your repo to your team-mates.


Each person should work on a separate branch to avoid a conflict nightmare. You can simply use your name as your branch name.

```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```


Then when you have coded something:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```


Work together to make something interesting!

## Ideas

A few ideas that might inspire you:

- Cape Town water vouchers.
- Your own token
- Crypto-*insert-animated-object-here*
- Donate to charity
- Bet on the world cup
